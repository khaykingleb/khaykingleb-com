This is the repository for my [personal website](https://khaykingleb.com).

## Tech Stack

## Prerequisites
The only prerequisite tool for this project is [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) â€” make sure you have it installed.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/khaykingleb/khaykingleb-com.git \
        && cd khaykingleb-com
    ```

2.  Initialize & setup:
    ```bash
    make init
    ```

    This command installs tools, dependencies, sets up `.env`, and pre-commit hooks.

3.  Configure environment:
    Edit the created `.env` file with your Supabase and Notion API keys.
