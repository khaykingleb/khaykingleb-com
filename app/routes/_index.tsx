            Hi there! I&apos;m Gleb, a full-stack developer specializing in
            DevOps and MLOps engineering. My background includes distributed
            systems, speech processing, speech synthesis, natural language
            processing, and finance. When I&apos;m not coding, you&apos;ll
            likely find me at the gym, lifting weights.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            I&apos;ve graduated summa cum laude from the Higher School of
            Economics, where I studied both Computer Science and Finance. This
            dual background helps me understand both the technical and business
            aspects of projects.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            On this site, you&apos;ll find a collection of resources that
            I&apos;ve found valuable. Feel free to explore, and I hope you
            discover some useful tools and materials for yourself! You can also
            find links to my Telegram channel (in Russian) and X profile (in
            English) in the footer below. It&apos;s where I share my thoughts
            and materials in a more freestyle format.
