            Welcome! I'm Gleb, a full-stack developer with a focus on DevOps and
            ML/MLOps engineering. Or, in simpler terms, I code things and
            occasionally break them...
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Early on, I had thoughts of being a software engineer, investment
            banker, or bodybuilder. Ultimately, I ended up at the Higher School
            of Economics, where I studied both Computer Science and Finance.
            This helps me understand not only the technical side of things but
            also the business aspects of projects. Outside of work, I enjoy
            hitting the weights at the gym. Who knows, maybe I'll end up as a
            bodybuilder after all if Devin AI is gonna make it? ðŸ¤”

            Here, youâ€™ll find a collection of resources Iâ€™ve found valuable.
            Dive in, and I hope you discover some tools and materials useful for
            yourself. Also, you can check out my Telegram channel in the footer
            below; it's where I share thoughts and materials in a more freestyle
            format.
